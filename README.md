# neku's discord css tweaks
some css filters for the ublock origin browser extension that make discord look more like before the recent update (2025/03/25)

## what they do
1. server icons are larger (can be adjusted in settings section)
2. the buttons for emojis, stickers, gifs, etc. are larger (can be adjusted in settings section)
3. dms are centered again (they removed the space on the right for some reason)
4. server icons are circular when you don't hover over them
5. the bar at the top is removed and the inbox button moved down

## how to apply them
if you have uBlock installed, go to settings by clicking on the extension's icon and then opening the dashboard (the gears icon in the bottom right of the menu).

in the settings, click on "My filters" at the top. copy the filters from `ublock-filters.txt` into the text box and then click on "Apply changes". once you refresh or open a new tab with discord running, the changes should be visible.
